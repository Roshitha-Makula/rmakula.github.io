            <h3>Project 1: Updating of GIS Maps with Water Bodies Change Detection</h3>
            <p>Conducted a research project focused on the detection and mapping of changes in water bodies using Very High-Resolution
                Satellite (VHRS) images. Utilized a deep learning model based on the UNet architecture and TensorFlow to process SENTINEL-2A satellite
                images. The detected changes were subsequently integrated into GIS maps using QGIS.</p>
            <p>Key Features: Deep Learning Model for Water Body Detection:
                Designed and implemented a Unet based model using TensorFlow to identify and delineate water bodies from SENTINEL-2A
               satellite images. The model was trained to recognize water bodies with high precision, ensuring accurate change detection.
               Change Detection Mechanism:
                Developed an algorithm to compare current and historical satellite images, identifying changes in the size, shape, or location of
               water bodies. This change detection mechanism aids in monitoring water body dynamics, crucial for environmental studies, urban planning,
               and disaster management.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: .Cotton Plant Disease Prediction</h3>
            <p>Developed an Android application that leverages deep learning to predict diseases in cotton plants. The primary objective is to
                provide timely alerts to farmers, preventing the spread of diseases over vast areas and ensuring optimal crop health. The application also offers
                guidance on pesticide usage and dosage, tailored to the identified disease.</p>
            <p>Key Features: Disease Prediction using CNN:
                Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyse and predict diseases from images of cotton plant leaves.
               Achieved an accuracy of 83.5% in disease prediction, ensuring reliable results for the end-users.</p>
